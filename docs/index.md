# Welcome!

Welcome to the KX.AS.CODE learning workstation. This virtual workstation was created with two primary goals in mind.

*   Play, learn, experiment, fail, learn, succeed :muscle: :trophy:
*   Share knowledge a code!


As well as learning and sharing knowledge, there are several more use cases for this KX workstation. Here just a few more:

*   Use it for demoing new technologies/tools/processes
*   Keep your physical workstation clean whilst experimenting
*   Have fun playing around with new technologies
*   Use it as an accompaniment to trainings and certifications
*   Experimenting and innovating
*   Test tool integrations
