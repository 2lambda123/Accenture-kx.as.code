# Roadmap

Just some ideas for now. Let us know your thoughts.

1. Expand the node portal we created. Still early days and lots to do.
2. Add possibility to deploy applications with Kustomize
3. ARM support, for running on Macs and maybe even a Raspberry Pi!
4. Add K3s when choosing KX.AS.CODE "Lite".
5. Add Private Cloud and Public Cloud builds to Jenkins setup
6. Add more central functions for Gitlab and other solutions

!!! tip
    You can suggest any further ideas to our [KX.AS.CODE Discord channel](https://discord.gg/FXeavNQnC5){:target="\_blank"}, and subsequently [raise a feature request](/Overview/Raising-a-Feature-Request/) on GitHub.com.
