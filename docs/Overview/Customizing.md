# Customizing KX.AS.CODE

You don't need to code to give KX.AS.CODE the look and feel you desire. If you add certain files to the profile directory, they will automatically be picked up and distributed as needed.

Here a short table detailing which files to drop for which customization.

| Filename | Target | Recommended Size (px) | Comments | Screenshot |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |

| Desktop Wallpaper | background.jpg | 3840 x 2160 | This will update the desktop background | ![](../../assets/images/kx.as.code_desktop.png) |
