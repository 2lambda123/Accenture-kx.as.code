def extendedDescription = "KX-Main nodes provide two core functions - Kubernetes master services as well as the desktop environment for easy access to deployed tools and documentation. Only the first KX-Main node hosts both the desktop environment, and the Kubernetes Master services. Subsequent KX-Main nodes host the Kubernetes Master services only. In a physical environment with 16GB ram or less, it is recommended to leave at least 4-6GB ram to the host operating system, leaving 10-12GB that can be allocated to KX-Main. In this scenario, it is recommended to set KX-Worker nodes to zero, and run the whole KX.AS.CODE setup in standalone mode."
